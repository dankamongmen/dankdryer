   <h2>Hohlraum</h2>
   <div class="proddesc">A fully assembled and tested Hohlraum suitable for
     use with Type B power outlets (as found in the US, Canada, Mexico, and
     Japan). Components will be printed using black carbon
     fiber-infused nylon and grey glass fiber-infused nylon (PA6).
     All filaments used are capable of sustained operation at 150℃.
     Exact filament may change from unit to unit.</div>
   <div class="buy"><a href="https://buy.stripe.com/28o5lT0Xy2Hc05qfZa">$250 + tax</a></div>
   <h2>Hohlraum components</h2>
   <div class="proddesc">The electrical components of a Hohlraum. You print
     and assemble the rest. Printing will require approximately 500g of
     filament using recommended settings. Assembly does not require soldering,
     and ought take approximately half an hour.</div>

   <h2>Instructions</h2>
   <h3>Warning</h3>
   <div class="proddesc">
     Many spools and filaments will melt at high temperatures. I recommend
     printing a
     <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/721131-universal-spool-v4-for-ams-ams-lite#profileId-651995">universal spool</a>
     using nylon. Do not exceed your spool's recommended temperatures.<br/>
   </div>
   <h3>Initial setup</h3>
   <div class="proddesc">
   For the assembled dryer, simply lift the top, and remove the packing
   material inside the upper chamber. There is no packing material in the
   lower chamber. Once the packing material is removed, put the top back
   on the upper chamber. If you're assembling the dryer, see
   <a href="assembly.html">these instructions</a>.<br/>
   <br/>
   Plug the supplied power cord into the side of the dryer, and into a
   120V AC outlet. Turn the dryer on using the switch on the side of the lower
   chamber. If power is flowing, it will light up. Both fans ought also
   start spinning.<br/>
   <br/>
   Bluetooth Low Energy GATT is used to configure networking. The device
   will appear as a BLE peripheral having the name "hohlraum" followed by
   some string. Connect, and write to the ESSID and PSK characteristics.
   Once they've been populated, the dryer will begin attempting to associate
   with the specified WiFi network (note: only 2.4GHz channels are supported).
   Once it successfully associates, these parameters are locked in, and
   can only be changed following a factory reset.<br/>
   <br/>
   Note that both spools and filament have melting temperatures. Heating
   them beyond these temperatures is likely to melt the material, ruining
   it and your dryer. If necessary, you are advised to print a spool
   using high-temperature materials.<br/>
   </div>
   <h3>Reporting</h3>
   <div class="proddesc">
   Upon pulling a DHCP lease, the dryer will serve HTTP on port 80, and
   will publish to an MQTT broker. The same information is available
   via both interfaces:<br/>
   <ul>
     <li>Uptime in seconds</li>
     <li>Temperature of the controller in degrees Celsius</li>
     <li>Temperature of the upper chamber in degrees Celsius</li>
     <li>Measured weight (tared) in grams</li>
     <li>Tare base in grams</li>
     <li>Upper (exhaust) fan speed in rotations per minute</li>
     <li>Lower (intake) fan speed in rotations per minute</li>
     <li>Upper fan duty cycle [0..255]</li>
     <li>Lower fan duty cycle [0..255]</li>
     <li>(*) Spool speed in rotations per minute</li>
     <li>(*) Target temperature in degrees Celsius</li>
     <li>(*) Heater status (on/off)</li>
     <li>(*) Motor status (on/off)</li>
     <li>(*) Time remaining in dry in seconds</li>
   </ul>
   Items marked with an asterisk are only expected to be non-zero during
   active drying. The heater will not necessarily run constantly during
   drying. The spool ought rotate at about 5 RPM when the motor is on.<br/>
   </div>
   <h3>Taring</h3>
   <div class="proddesc">
     Taring calibrates the scale's zero point. Taring ought be performed without
     a spool (or anything else) sitting on the platform, but with the motor, the
     motor coupling, and the platform all installed. Simply press the Tare Scale
     button on the web page, or post to the <tt>control/ID/tare</tt> MQTT topic.
     Taring is instantaneous.
   </div>
   <h3>Drying</h3>
   <div class="proddesc">
     Remove the top and place a spool of filament into the upper chamber,
     atop the spool platform. The spool ought sit level. Replace the top.
     Without the top in place, drying will be less effective and consume
     more power. Note that generic spools will melt under high temperatures;
     if drying at 80℃ or more, be sure to use a high-temperature spool.<br/>
     <br/>
     Drying can be initiated via the HTTP server, or via MQTT. It is necessary
     to specify the target temperature (in degrees Celsius) and the length of
     the dry (in seconds).<br/>
     <br/>
     When drying is complete, remove the top and extract the spool. The
     spool might be hot.<br/>
   </div>
   <h3>Updating firmware</h3>
   <div class="proddesc">
     Firmware can only be updated through the web page. Firmware updates are
     expected to be a very rare event. Press Select Firmware, and choose the
     file using the provided dialog. Press Upload Firmware. The update
     process ought take less than a minute.
   </div>
   <h3>Factory reset</h3>
   <div class="proddesc">
     Post to the <tt>control/ID/factoryreset</tt> MQTT topic, or click the Factory Reset
     button on the web page. This will reset networking options and tare
     settings, and cancel any ongoing drying activity.

ESP32-S3 firmware and SCAD sources for the Dankdryer, the world's best filament dryer.

# Features

* Temperatures up to at least 125C when printed with proper materials.
  * Such temperatures are appropriate (necessary) for certain engineering filaments.
  * A high-temperature spool is required at these temperatures.
* Accurate weight sensing throughout to determine how much water has been exorcised.
  * Post contextless deltas to reddit in the heat of dumbass arguments! DATA, bitch!
* Slow rotation like delicious savory meat.
* Equal heating of all the spool's filament.
* Reads RFID tags and applies correct config.
* Control and reporting over MQTT via WiFi.
* OTA firmware upgrades.
* Isolated hot and cool chambers, with most active equipment in the cool chamber.
* Humidity sensing and temperature sensing in both chambers.
* Entirely open source.

# Dependencies

The project is built with GNU Make.
Running `make` in the toplevel will attempt to build firmware and STLs.
Building the firmware requires the `esp-idf` library and a configured
ESP-IDF environment (i.e. the various `IDF_*` environment variables
must be set), along with CMake. `idf.py` ought be in your `$PATH`,
and work when invoked.

A network configuration file must be created and populated at
`esp32-s3/dankdryer/dryer-network.h`.

## Firmware
* [esp-idf](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf) 5.3+
* [CMake](https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake) 3.16+

## 3D models
* OpenSCAD 2021.01+
* JÃ¶rg Janssen's [gears.scad](https://github.com/chrisspen/gears) 2.2+
* [BOSL2](https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2)

# Construction

The following pieces are printed:
 * lower (cool) chamber
 * upper (hot) chamber
 * top
 * worm gear
 * lower coupling (load cell to bearing)
 * shaft (runs through bearing, gear, spacers, and platform)
 * platform
 * gear
 * lower spacer
 * upper spacer

Use heat-resistant filaments. My lower chamber is polycarbonate, and my upper
chamber is Bambu PAHT-CF. You obviously don't want to use a target temperature
within 10% of your material's heat deformation temperature.

Additionally, you'll need a ceramic heating element, a buck converter, an AC
adapter, an ESP32-S3 devkit, a [Geartisan 12V motor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B071XCX778),
a TB6612FNG motor controller, a 5kg load cell and its HX711 controller, two
NF-A8 80mm fans, two Molex 4-pin fan connectors, a 608 bearing, a ~3A inline fuse,
a RC522 13.56 MHz RFID reader, and hookup wire. Soldering will be required.

## Preparing the AC cords

* Cut the female end off of a 16 AWG grounded NEMA 5-15 cable.
* Strip ~5cm down to the three insulated wires.
* Strip each wire down to ~1cm.
* Insert the live wire into the inline fuse and secure with heat shrink.
* Terminate each wire (fused live, neutral, and ground) with a ring or spade terminal + heatwrap.
* Prepare two wires of length ~20cm and AWG between 22 and 18.
  * Terminate one end of each wire with a ring or spade terminal + heatwrap.
  * Terminate the other end of each wire with a female quick disconnect terminal + heatwrap.

## Assembling the lower chamber

* Place the motor atop the motor stand, and secure it with six screws.
* Attach the worm gear to the rotor.
* Secure the AC adapter with two screws.
* Run the AC cable through the circular hole, and the two prepared wires through the wire channel along the floor.
  * Connect the AC cable's live wire and one of the other wires at the AC adapter's 'L'(ive) screw terminal.
  * Connect the AC cable's neutral wire and one of the other wires at the AC adapter's 'N'(eutral) screw termninal.
  * Connect the AC cable's ground wire to the AC adapter's ground screw terminal.
* Secure the buck converter with two screws.
* Secure the load cell with two screws.
* Secure the perfboard with two screws.
* Secure a fan to the outside with four screws, blowing in.

## Assembling the central column

* The lower coupling is mounted onto the load cell with two screws.
* Insert the shaft into the bearing.
* Push the lower spacer down atop the bearing.
* Push the gear down atop the lower spacer.
* Push the upper spacer down atop the gear.
  * There will be space left on the shaft.
* **Gently** place the bearing into the recess at the top of the lower coupling.
* Secure the air shield with three screws.

## Assembling the top chamber

* Secure a fan to the outside with four screws, blowing out.
* Secure the heating element with four screws.
* Terminate both wires of the heating element with male quick disconnect terminals.
* Connect the heater wires and the prepared wires, using the circular hole in the top chamber's floor.
* Secure the top chamber with four screws.
* **Gently** place the platform onto the top of the shaft.

# Questions

* How does air flow? Let's get some visible air and test it.
* The ESP32-S3 has a MCPWM, a motor controller. Can we eliminate the TB6612FNG?
* Would we benefit from thermal insulation material in the hotbox?
* Can we replace the lower 80x80mm fan with e.g. 4x 40x40mm fans, and reduce height?
* Ought we change our circuits to add protection or eliminate noise?
* Ought we replace the perfboard and its various breakouts with a custom PCB?
* Can we use a smaller (cheaper) motor / AC adapter?
* How useful would it be to read Bambu RFID tags? How feasible?
